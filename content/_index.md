## Parallel-SSH

`parallel-ssh` is an asynchronous parallel SSH library designed for large scale automation.

It differentiates ifself from alternatives, other libraries and higher level frameworks like Ansible or Chef in several ways:

* Scalability - Scales to hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands hosts or more.
* Ease of use - Running commands over any number of hosts can be achieved in as little as two lines of code.
* Speed - Fastest Python SSH library available - see [performance comparison](/post/parallel-ssh-libssh2).
* Resource use - Uses the least resources, both CPU and memory, of any other Python SSH library.
* And more.

```shell
pip install parallel-ssh
```
